<h2> THE ROTTEN</h2>
<P> Once upon a time, a long time ago, Anansi visited the Sky God. The
Sky God liked him so much that he gave Anansi, and only Anansi, the gift of
storytelling so that Anansi could spin stories about life on earth.
    Akili and Jabari are excited to share the folktales
they’ve gathered from across the African conti-
nent. From Ghana, Liberia, and Nigeria in West Af-
rica to Kenya in East Africa to Zimbabwe and South
Africa in - you guessed it! - South Africa, their stories
come from a variety of different people and tribes.
Set in an African market, African Folktales includes
some characters that may already be familiar, as well
as introducing new stories that you probably haven’t
heard before.
African folktales were passed down
orally through generations - that means that they were
told verbally instead of written down on paper and read.
They also tend to be very interactive - so get ready to
participate! You may be asked to help make sound
effects, call out a certain word at a certain time, or
even come up on stage to help tell a part of the story!
Many African folktales use animals who act like humans in order to teach a lesson. Other tales
explain why an animal looks or acts the way they do, or how that animal came to have a specif-
ic character trait. A common character in African folktales is the trickster - usually an animal
who is smaller in size than the others and who uses his wits to outsmart others. Sometimes the
trickster is very funny, and sometimes he or she is not likable at all! Anansi the Spider is proba-
bly the most famous of the African tricksters. Our show includes a funny story about Anansi
that explains how he got his long, skinny legs, and also teaches a lesson about being greedy.
Music and movement are big parts of traditional African storytelling. Akili and Jabari use
drums, their voices, and parts of their bodies to make music.
And watch how they change
the way they move across the market to portray animals as opposed to humans! We know
that you’ll have fun while learning a lot about African culture, storytelling, and literature!
